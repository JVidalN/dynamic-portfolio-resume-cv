# My Resume CV

[Portuguese](readme-ptBR.md) version.

This is my online resume, created to showcase my experience, skills and my projects.

This template was designed by [Xiaoying Riley](http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com) and modified by me with improvements that i considered relevants.

## Updates

For the updates i used features of ECMAScript like: `Use Strict`, `Dynamic Imports`, `Arrow Functions`, `Destructuring Assignment`, `String Interpolation`, `Const and Let Variables`. In addition, some design patterns were used, such as `Factory`, `Dependency Injection`.

The data is obtained the public API data from github itself `https://api.github.com/users/${user}/repos`.

The cards layout was inpired in [this](https://codepen.io/mhrkit/pen/GGqdvr?editors=1010) example, created by M H Rabby.

### Other Sections

I cleaned the code generating the scripts by [data source](assets/js/data.mjs) to create elements HTML.
